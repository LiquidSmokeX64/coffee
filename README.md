# Coffee Linux v.23.3.3 "Winey"

What is CoffeeLinux?

It is a distro, but not in a typical sense. This is pure Arch Linux, using the exact same ISO and creation method. However, CoffeeLinux has improved upon the installation method significantly.

The installation requires Internet, and builds the OS for you via a special script that automates the entire process.

The installer script itself will ask a few questions to set things up according to your preferences then proceed to install the OS automatically.

There are several desktop options to select from including Gnome, KDE, and Cinnamon. There are other less tested desktop options as well.

Many improvements have gone into catering to the gaming community, so there are options for Steam, Heroic Games, and Lutris if you want these apps.

There are choices to include other applications such as Java, LibreOffice, Github Desktop, VMware, and Snap support. So being productive is easier than ever.

There are a host of "under the hood" improvements made to the system as well satisfying dependencies and optional support for many basic OS components to ensure you have the best experience possible immediately.

If you ever wanted to try out real Arch Linux (Not a distro like Manjaro) but felt it was too much of a hassle to do it yourself, CoffeeLinux is made for you.

Welcome to the new age of Arch Linux installation, welcome to CoffeeLinux, we ope you enjoy your stay. Why hop distros, when you can have it all?

Don't believe me, try it for yourself..

Just use Etcher to write the iso to usb, and go. Easy-peezy
