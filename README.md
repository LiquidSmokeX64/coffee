# Welcome to CoffeeLinux.
-----------------------------------

CoffeeLinux is a Linux distribution optimized for gaming, yet its performance extends to other areas as well, offering a noticeable improvement across the board.

Built on Arch, CoffeeLinux is designed to provide a streamlined, hassle-free installation process. From start to finish, the setup is simple, enabling users to begin their experience quickly and efficiently.

The installer is a lightweight, shell-based setup. We believe in a straightforward approach, foregoing unnecessary graphical interfaces in favor of a direct, efficient installation process. With just a few simple steps, you’ll be up and running in no time.

What sets CoffeeLinux apart from other distributions is its custom-crafted installer, a modified version of the Arch ISO (releng profile). This installer uses a single script to perform the entire installation based on your preferences, significantly reducing the need for copying packages from the installation medium. The installation process mirrors a manual Arch Linux setup, ensuring greater flexibility and control.

CoffeeLinux delivers the power of Arch with added ease and convenience. Join us and experience it for yourself.

**Features of CoffeeLinux:**

- **Command Line installation**:  Simple easy to use universal installer without all that flashy unneeded GUI to cause problems. (Trust me it's better this way.)

- **Zen Kernel**: A more focused kernel to get the most out of your gaming experience.

- **ZRAM Enabled**: A more modern, efficient alternative to the default ZSWAP, giving back that precious Hard Drive space for more of what you want instead.

- **QoL Packages**: Essential packages and dependencies, designed to optimize the experience across a wide range of applications and services. ie: Java, etc.

- **Wayland Focused**:  The software stack is entirely built with Wayland functionality in mind (including Nvidia GPUs). X11 support is limited at best by default.

- **GPU Friendly**:  AMD or Nvidia GPUs welcome (Intel... maybe..)

- **Gaming Ready**:  Lutris, Wine, Steam, Heroic Games Launcher (Epic/GOG/Amazon), and Discord built in.

- **Gaming Tools**: DXVK-Bin, Winetricks, Protontricks, and ProtonUp-QT built in.

- **OS level fixes**: Some games and apps require extra push to get running so fixes have been integrated for CPU Mitigations (13th Gen Intel, etc), VM Max Map Count (Horizon Zero Dawn, etc), DotNet 4.8 installations (Space Engineers, etc), and Nvidia Smooth Motion enabled (Nvidia 40xx+ GPU required)

- **Lightweight Desktop Environment**:  Plasma (KDE). Ideal for everyday use, and enthusiasts alike.

- **Installer Self-Updater**: Installer script, and misc files are auto-updated on the installation medium prior to use to always give the latest available version.

- **Bootloader Options**: Supports both **Grub UEFI** and **Grub BIOS** for flexible boot management.

- **CoffeeLinux Manager (WIP)**: A console scripted application designed to simplify common tasks, including:
   1. **System Updater** for distribution-specific updates.
   2. **Application manager** (install and remove software).
   3. **System information** (via fastfetch).
   4. **Coffee ISO Maker**: Easily create updated CoffeeLinux ISOs.
   5. **Pacman Switcher**: Switch between stable and beta system update channels.
   6. **Steam Library Fixer**: Resolve Steam library links on secondary NTFS drives.
   7. **Discord Updater Tool**: Manually updates Discord app from official tar.gz file.

To get started, simply download the ISO from the *Releases* page, use Etcher to write it to a USB drive, and proceed as you would with any other Arch ISO installation.

My Linux is the end of the distro war. It just needs some coffee to calm down.
