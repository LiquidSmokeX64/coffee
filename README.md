# Welcome to CoffeeLinux.

-----------------------------------

CoffeeLinux is a distro designed with gaming in mind.

However.. due to this lofty goal it excells in other areas quite nicely.
The performance difference is noticable.

Based on Arch, CoffeeLinux aims to provide a smooth setup from start to finish so you can get right to it.

The Installer is a pure shell installation. No need for a fancy GUI just to install an OS honestly.

Just a few simple choices and you're ready to go.

CoffeeLinux is unique to other distros because its installer is a hand crafted mod for archiso (releng profile) that uses a single script to install the OS for you based on your choices.
 
There is no copying packages and such from the installation medium (unless needed).

Everything is downloaded and installed live for your installation as if you were installing Arch Linux manually (because you are technically).

CoffeeLinux Self-Updating Service Script runs every boot to ensure you are good to go.

This is Arch but better. Enjoy it with us.

----------------------------------

Unique Features:

CoffeeLinux Manager app. For some basic tasks made simpler.

Chrome, Lutris, LibreOffice, Steam, Epic, and Discord ready to go.

Snap Store for Snaps (if desired).

Pamac Application Manager GUI.

Flatpack support via KDE Application Manager (Discover).

Custom made self updating service: Stay up to date with no user interaction. Runs on boot by default.

A hand picked set of QoL packages and dependencies preinstalled for a large number of apps and services to work better.

------------------------------------

Like, Share, and Enjoy. 
My Linux is the end of the distro war. It just needs some coffee to calm down.
