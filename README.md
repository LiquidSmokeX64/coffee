# Welcome to CoffeeLinux.
-----------------------------------

CoffeeLinux is a Linux distribution optimized for gaming, yet its performance extends to other areas as well, offering a noticeable improvement across the board.

Built on Arch Linux, CoffeeLinux is designed to provide a streamlined, hassle-free installation process. From start to finish, the setup is simple, enabling users to begin their experience quickly and efficiently.

The installer is a lightweight, shell-based setup. We believe in a straightforward approach, foregoing unnecessary graphical interfaces in favor of a direct, efficient installation process. With just a few simple steps, you’ll be up and running in no time.

What sets CoffeeLinux apart from other distributions is its custom-crafted installer, a modified version of the Arch ISO (releng profile). This installer uses a single script to perform the entire installation based on your preferences, significantly reducing the need for copying packages from the installation medium. The installation process mirrors a manual Arch Linux setup, ensuring greater flexibility and control.

Concerned about managing updates? We’ve got you covered. The CoffeeLinux Self-Updating Service is designed to simplify maintenance. Once activated, the service takes care of everything in the background with minimal user intervention—just reboot (sometimes twice), and your system will stay up to date.

CoffeeLinux delivers the power of Arch with added ease and convenience. Join us and experience it for yourself.
