# Coffee Linux v.24.3.8 "Xeno"

What is CoffeeLinux?

Effectively it's a mod for pure Arch Linux's Iso designed to make it much easier to use and provide a better quality final product.

Simply apply the mod files to any clean Archiso releng profile and thats it.

The original installation script for a standard Arch Linux OS is difficult to use, and incomplete to some extent.

Coffee Linux aims to correct this problem through a much simpler easy to use script.

A custom install script is available too allowing the OS to be assembled via a series of questions to cater to exactly what you want within certain perameters.

The entire installation process features a default setup in case one just wants to hit "Enter" a few times and be done.

With Coffee Linux there is no longer any confusing guides to follow, no need to use a forked distro like Manjaro. You can have real Arch Linux, don't settle for second best.

Coffee Linux provides a full set of packages for every desktop environment, and a series of quality of life improvements via the Coffee Linux Extras.

Coffee Linux extras include many dependencies for a ton of everday applications, firmware patches, and other little things to make your experience the best I can provide out of the box.

There are a list of optional applications and services as well to choose from such as Steam, Java, LibreOffice, VMWare, Snapd framework, Heroic Games Launcher, Lutris, Github Desktop, Discord, and a few popular Web Browsers.

The idea here is to bring real Arch Linux to everyone, and effectively end the need for a distro war.

Everyone knows Arch is king under Gentoo, it's just confusing to install in a similar way. I've fixed that problem. Enjoy.

Stop settling for hackjob distros. You're better than that aren't you?
