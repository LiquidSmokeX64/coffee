# Welcome to CoffeeLinux.

-----------------------------------

CoffeeLinux is a distro designed with gaming in mind.

However.. due to this lofty goal it excells in other areas quite nicely.
The performance difference is noticable.

Based on Arch, CoffeeLinux aims to provide a smooth setup from start to finish so you can get right to it.

The Installer is a pure shell installation. No need for a fancy GUI just to install an OS honestly.
  Just a few simple choices and you're ready to go.

With 3 Standard Desktop Environment choices, it's easy to find the one that suits you best.

CoffeeLinux is unique to other distros because its installer is a hand crafted mod for archiso (releng profile) that uses a single script to install the OS for you based on your choices.
 
There is no copying packages and such. Everything is downloaded and installed live for your installation.

Don't like updating? I hear you..

CoffeeLinux Self-Updating Service is made just for you.
No more waitimg for updates, with this service you just reboot (twice sometimes). 
Seriously that's it. It takes care of all the maintenence for you in the background.
You do nothing.

This is Arch but better. Enjoy it with us.
